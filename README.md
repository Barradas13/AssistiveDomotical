# AutonomingThingsWithBlinks
About 12.5 million Brazilian people face daily challenges due to fisical deficiencies. Consequently, these individuals have dependency which restrict personal autonomy, generating a bad life experience. Technology opens a way to improve the lives of these people, making it possible to do simple actions such as change a tvâ€™s channel. The advance of domotical technology allows the expansion of these tasks and more complexical ones in an integrated way with low costs and easy use. Therefore it's possible to control and monitor an entire house. The objective of this project is to provide tetraplegics people a better quality of life that allows them to have autonomy in everyday tasks. This way, a software is being developed to integrate the movements of eyes with a residential devices interface. Using the programming language Python, the libraries OpenCV and Dlib, the detection of face points will be valuable for making a calculus to verify the status of the eye and send this data to a microcontroller that makes the required automation. Soon, people with severe paralysis would have personal autonomy and more life quality with a low cost.
